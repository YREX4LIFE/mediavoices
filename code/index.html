        Media Voices is an online database that makes it easier for journalists
        to find credible Canadian experts. By including diverse voices in their
        coverage, journalists are better able to reflect Canadaâ€™s increasing
        diversity in their content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to help Canadian communities reclaim their narratives by 
        amplifying pertinent voices. One way we are doing this is by building a 
        database of experts in various subject areas to help journalists in their 
        quest for inclusion and diversity. We also hope to work with diverse 
        communities to encourage them and equip them with the tools and skills 
        necessary to tell their own stories and to communicate their knowledge and 
        opinions in an effective way.
